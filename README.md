# AgriBlockchain
## Agriculture Produce Tracking System

AgriBlockchain is a decentralized platform that brings transparency, trust, and accountability to the agriculture supply chain. It allows every stakeholder — from farmers to consumers — to track the journey of agricultural produce with ease.

## Overview
The agriculture supply chain often suffers from lack of transparency, counterfeit products, and trust issues. AgriBlockchain solves this by ensuring that every step — from farm to consumer — is recorded in a secure, tamper-proof system.

With this solution:

- Farmers can prove the authenticity and quality of their produce.
- Distributors can update transport and storage details.
- Retailers can provide verified sales records.
- Consumers can scan a QR code to view the entire history of the product.
